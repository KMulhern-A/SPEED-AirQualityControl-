# Weather Data,

I have downloaded the weather data from German wether stations,

They are in the Data folder,

* cdc_download_2020-07-06_19 15.zip - 1 station, Kiel I think for  1945?
* cdc_download_2020-07-08_10_39.zip - 2 stations, Flensburg

In the archives there is a data directory. they hold data for two different stations.

* `*_DD_*.csv` is wind direction in the `Wert` field (Deg Clockways from due south)
* `*_FX_*.csv` is the wind speed `Wert` field (m/s)

These are timestamped hourly and mean averages.
