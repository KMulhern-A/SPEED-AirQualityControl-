### Challenge Description

This challenge is about developing an Air Quality application.

* Uses predicted weather conditions including wind, pressure and temperature to determine likelihood (%) of poor air quality
* Should utilise seasonal data for worst air pollution time (April) for some pollutants
* Should utilise time of day for worst pollutants and retention of pollutants at a low level.
* Should utilise government warning sites of high pollen/high pollution likelihood
* Should be able to integrate and interpret data stream from air pollutant sensors in port


| Challenge Owner                                        | Portsmouth Port / Portland Port                                                                                                             |
| Related smart port application domain                  | Optimizing energy efficiency / climate impact of port logistics                                                                             |
| Potential stakeholders                                 | Software and IT                                                                                                                             |
| Subcategory                                            |                                                                                                                                             |
| Other related stakeholders                             | Port Operations                                                                                                                             |
| Potential improvements to port logistics ecosystems    | This app will help to measure the air quality in ports and optimise impact on ports.                                                        |
| Use of “smart technology” for resolving this challenge | Sensors can be used to collect data for wind, temperature, pressure, etc. and IoT and Data Science can be used to predict poor air quality. |
| Potential positive environmental effect                | Predicting poor air quality may help to plan port logistics earlier and optimise the impact on air quality.                                 |
